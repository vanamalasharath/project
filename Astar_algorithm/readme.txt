Team members:

2) Sharath vanamala

Entire coding is done in Python

**Before running the code you should install the following modules 
  1.numpy
  2.matplotlib

steps to run the program:

1. Download the source code file
2. Please make sure that connections.txt and locations.txt are in the same folder as the source code file 
4. Run the source code file A-Star.py 
5. Inputs
   a)Start city
   b)End city
   c)City names to be excluded(If you want to enter more than one city make sure you enter a single space between each city, If you dont want to exclude any city just press enter)
   d) Enter 1 to view Step by step and optimal path
            2 to view only optimal path
   e) Enter 1 for straight line distance
            2 for fewest cities

   
Extra credit

Graph traversal opens as a new window(map)

It has all the initial connections in "black"
The optimal path is shown in "Red"
The nodes visited before deciding the optimal path is shown in "yellow" with dotted line
